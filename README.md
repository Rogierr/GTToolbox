# GTToolbox

Welcome to the GTToolbox, an abbreviation of the full name "Game Theoretical Toolbox".

This toolbox contains a multitude of algorithms, most of them are developed by Reinoud Joosten, Rogier Harmelink and Llea Samuel. For now, it is a work-in-progress. There is however some literature using/developing the algorithms from this Toolbox:

On the computation of large sets of rewards in ETP-ESP-games with communicating states (https://research.utwente.nl/en/publications/on-the-computation-of-large-sets-of-rewards-in-etp-esp-games-with)

On Stochastic Fishery Games with Endogenous Stage-Payoffs and Transition Probabilities
(https://research.utwente.nl/en/publications/on-stochastic-fishery-games-with-endogenous-stage-payoffs-and-tra)

Also a MSc. thesis on the threat point algorithm is written
(https://essay.utwente.nl/77278/)

The main programmer of this toolbox is Rogier Harmelink, please contact him on r.l.a.harmelink@utwente.nl for questions regarding this toolbox.
